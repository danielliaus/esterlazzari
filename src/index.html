                  Childbearing delay is a pervasive feature of Australian society, but little research has been
                  conducted to examine how socio-economic factors are linked to childbearing timing among Australian men
                  and women. This paper addresses this by analysing the timing of first childbirth for a large sample of
                  Australian residents (N = 4,444). The findings indicate that childbearing delay is socially patterned
                  and that life course experiences shape the risk of delaying childbearing across genders. Having a
                  tertiary qualification delays the transition to parenthood, especially for women. An uninterrupted
                  career prolongs time to parenthood for women but accelerates it for men. Low occupational prestige,
                  being married and having been in only one co-residential union are associated with earlier parenthood
                  for both men and women. For each increase in education level, not being married is associated with
                  increasing levels of childlessness. Clear-cut gender differences are found in the relationship between
                  childlessness and childbearing delay.

                  Extensive literature has documented the contribution of rising women’s education to decreases in completed
                  cohort fertility (CCF). A key question related to the education–fertility relationship is to what extent the
                  decrease in fertility is the result of changes in educational composition vs changes in fertility behaviours
                  within educational categories. This study quantified the effect of educational expansion on fertility levels
                  by decomposing the overall change in CCF into educational composition and education-specific fertility, and
                  explored the changes in parity-specific components of CCF by education for cohorts born between 1940 and 1970.
                  The results show that, despite the decline in CCF being caused mostly by changes in fertility behaviours,
                  educational composition had a considerable impact for some cohorts. The decline in third and higher-order
                  births played a central role in the fall in CCF across educational …

                  Over the past three decades the median age of mothers in Australia has continued to rise, although age-patterns of childbearing vary widely between poorer and wealthier areas. Using data on the number of children ever born to women aged 15 years and over sourced from the 2006 and 2016 censuses, this DemoGraphic examines changes in the timing and quantum of childbearing of Australian mothers across different socio-economic statuses.

                  Little is known about whether and how trends in completed cohort fertility and lifetime childlessness by education have changed over time. This study uses census data to describe the changes in completed family size and proportions ultimately childless by educational attainment of Australian women born between 1952–1971 (N= 2,518,571). In all cohorts, better-educated women have lower fertility levels than their lesser-educated counterparts. The decline in completed fertility has, however, slowed among recent cohorts of women with university degrees, while it has been declining at a faster pace among women with Year 12 and Diploma qualifications. The positive effect of education on childlessness has also reduced. The gap in ultimate childlessness between women with university degrees and women with Year 12 qualifications or below has been markedly narrowing across the cohorts under observation …

                  Using data sourced from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, binary and multinomial logistic regression models are estimated to analyse the correlates of perceived infertility, and the relationship between perceived infertility and contraceptive use of 1,654 couples. Results show that both biological and life-course interference factors are strong predictors of the perception of infertility at the couple level, with women’s characteristics more influential than their partner’s characteristics. Additionally, couples with perceived infertility are less likely to use contraception, regardless of their short-term intentions or desire to have a child.                </p>
